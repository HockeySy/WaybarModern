# Welcome to ZephyrWay - A waybar with Soul
"In the silence of tiling windows i crafted not just bar - but a swayKh, abreath between chaos and control"

Welcome, traeler of the terminal. This is ZephyrWay, a personal and minimalist configuration of Waybar, inspired by thought, precision, and the desire build -
no just to copy
