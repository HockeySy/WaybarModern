# Welcome to ZephyrWay - A waybar with Soul
"In the silence of tiling windows i crafted not just bar - but a swayKh, abreath between chaos and control"

Welcome, traeler of the terminal. This is ZephyrWay, a personal and minimalist configuration of Waybar, inspired by thought, precision, and the desire build -
no just to copy

Built upon the foundation of swayKh, with deep respect and credit to its structure, this project stands as both a remix and a reflection.

Whether you're a wanderer in the land of dotfiles, a lover of clean design, or just seeking a bar that speaks your language â€” you're home.

# Install - let the bar breache yout desktop

Clone the configuration:
"""git clone  https://github.com/HockeySy/WaybayModern.git"""
