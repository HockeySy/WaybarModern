# Welcome to ZephyrWay - A waybar with Soul
"In the silence of tiling windows i crafted not just bar - but a swayKh, abreath between chaos and control"

Welcome, traeler of the terminal. This is ZephyrWay, a personal and minimalist configuration of Waybar, inspired by thought, precision, and the desire build -
no just to copy

Built upon the foundation of swayKh, with deep respect and credit to its structure, this project stands as both a remix and a reflection.

Whether you're a wanderer in the land of dotfiles, a lover of clean design, or just seeking a bar that speaks your language — you're home.

# Install - let the bar breache yout desktop

Clone the configuration:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HockeySy/WaybarModern.git
```

# Credits & Soul

This config would not exist without the clean architecture and vision of @swayKh — much respect to their foundation, which I’ve reshaped into something uniquely mine.

# Contributions – The Terminal is Open

Found a better way? A cool idea? Open a PR or issue — all respectful input is welcome. This is a living config, and it breathes better with community.

# Customization – Make It Yours

Though it comes with a soul, ZephyrWay welcomes your touch. Tweak modules, change colors, add scripts — bend it to your will.

> "It is not a tool for control,
but a companion for expression."

# Final Thoughts

If you’ve made it this far, thank you. This project, while simple in function, is the result of personal effort, late nights, and a desire to bring clarity and minimalism to an often chaotic desktop experience.

ZephyrWay is not a revolution — it’s a reflection. A reflection of a preference for clean design, thoughtful layout, and the idea that even the smallest details matter when you're building a system you live in every day.

Feel free to use it, customize it, learn from it, or even improve it. Contributions, suggestions, and forks are welcome — and deeply appreciated.

If this config helps make your environment more personal, more usable, or simply more beautiful, then this project has served its purpose.

Thanks for visiting,
Zephar
